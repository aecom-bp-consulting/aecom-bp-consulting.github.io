It serves as a barometer of health, reporting on what is happening in your body right at this instant.

Founded in March of 2013, Public Funds Investment & Reporting (PFITR, ) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology company that enables those responsible for overseeing tax dollars to see valuation metrics based on market transactions to make the best investment decisions possible. Treasurers, Directors of Finance, public CFOs—all are examples of public fiduciaries who oversee, cumulatively, trillions of dollars in their operational accounts.
State statutes and internal investment policies govern the three mandates of safety, liquidity, and yield. Keeping the investments safe involves identifying, measuring and mitigating risk. Liquidity is the second mandate and most entities keep an excess amount of cash and cash equivalents and because they lack the cash flow analytics required.
Buying too high, hidden commissions, and holding too much cash often sacrifice yield. Our BPV™ tool provides them the analytics and internal controls to guide public fiduciaries to lessen risk, commissions, and poor timing.
How do public fiduciaries, so burdened with conflicting demands and looming risks, respond? They either avoid doing anything or they take the advice of the bank or broker making the recommendation. Many public fiduciaries lack the experience, technology and training to make optimal investment purchases, so they are dependent on the recommendations of the broker because most do not use an advisor. There is an inherent conflict of interest in many recommendations because, generally speaking, brokerages receive higher commissions when the product sold is riskier generally . Most public fiduciaries are under-diversified, over-liquid and earning too little on their multi-million dollar portfolios.</p><p><a href='http://twitter.com/pfitr target='_blank'>Twitter</a>",38.6729715,-90.6414314

As guys from the Midwest, our Normal has always been between the city and the country. Our family of 7 brothers and 3 sisters grew up in the city but escaped to the outdoors every weekend or day off. We hunted, fished, spent nights around the fire and days at the lake, but still lived in, worked in, and loved the hustle of a city.

This whole thing started because we couldn't find a shirt that would hold up to our lifestyle. We needed a brand that made sense to us — to our day-to-day. We wanted a Normal shirt.

To do that, we have sourced the finest fabrics from around the world and introduced them to an everyday sensibility. Our style is straightforward but significant. Durability and versatility are of the utmost importance, and every detail matters. Beat it up outside and take it out to dinner that night — that’s the life.

"Midwest Cyber Center","735 Seibert Road, Scott Air Force Base, IL, United States","Who We Are:

The Midwest Cyber Center (MC²) was created in response to a comprehensive needs analysis study. Findings in the report suggested a need to increase the supply of cyber security professionals to meet the current and future demand of employers in the Midwest region. MC² has quickly established itself as a backbone organization grounded in Midwestern values that will lead the region to become a cyber ecosystem other communities will follow. 

What We Do:

Train this generation of cyber professionals - We recognize the importance for a strong regional cybersecurity workforce. There is an alarming deficit in the industry and it is critical we close the gap. Our initial solution is to offer industry specific certifications to under and unemployed individuals, to transitioning veterans, and to graduating college students from either a two-year, four-year, or post-graduation program. Looking ahead to 2017, we will develop our own cyber coursework designed to train and engage non-traditional students in the cyber industry. 

Inspire the next generation of cyber professionals - It is critical we educate today’s youth on how to protect themselves, and introduce the career opportunities available in cybersecurity. To ensure this happens, we will introduce CyberPatriot to the region. CyberPatriot leads middle and high school students to compete in cyber defense competitions. The program equips youth with the skills necessary to be tomorrow’s cyber professional.

Educate the community-at-large on their role in the cyber ecosystem - Cybersecurity is not solely a government problem. Every business owner and citizen should actively participate and thoroughly understand their role. Through strategic and tactical focused events and white papers, we will inform the region of the risks present and empower them to take a proactive stance personally and professionally to protect themselves.</p><p><a href='https://twitter.com/mwcybercoe target='_blank'>Twitter</a><br><a href='https://www.facebook.com/midwestcybercenter/ target='_blank'>Facebook</a></p><br><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/10265774?trk=prof-exp-company-name target='_blank'>Linkedin</a></p>",38.5479868,-89.8719305
