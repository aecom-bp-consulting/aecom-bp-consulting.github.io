        <p> The City of Los Angelesâ€™ General Plan Growth Strategy (or Framework Element) informs land use decisions and
            is a blueprint for how the City should allocate resources, guide citywide development, and promote long-term
            growth over several decades. AECOM is helping provide the Los Angeles Department of City Planning (LACP)
            with the technical, public engagement, and project management support to update the Framework Element. </p>
        <p> A vital component of this was the equity & employment analysis for the City of Los Angeles. For this
            analysis, AECOM leveraged data from the American Community Survey (ACS), Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),
            Quarterly Census of Employment and Workforce (QCEW), supplemented by a thorough review of existing
            literature. The first report deliverable covered an overview of economic trends, issues, and opportunities
            for development across the City, a commuting analysis based on Jobs-Housing balances, a breakdown of racial,
            ethnic, and gender-based equity in employment opportunities, and a report on identifiable emerging trends in
            development across the City. In particular, the Jobs-Housing analysis
            helped identify commuting patterns, as well as neighborhoods that were underserved with respect to housing.
            The equity analysis helped understand the differences across different demographic groups with respect to
            incomes and job opportunities/access.
        </p>
        <p> The employment analysis for the City of Los Angeles leveraged confidential QCEW point data to map locations
            of businesses. AECOM used in-house crosswalks to establish connections between groups of industries and land
            use data, allowing the City to understand the impacts employment has on physical development. Identifying
            areas with above-average employment concentrations, High-Density Employment Districts were formulated for
            Retail, Commercial, Industrial, Office, and Institutional employment, allowing a geospatial analysis of
            their impacts on and implications for access to jobs, wages, and future development. These districts were
            refined through collaboration with LACP through an ArcGIS StoryMap that illustrated the locations of these
            districts. </p>
