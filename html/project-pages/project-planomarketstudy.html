        <p> The City of Plano, TX, contracted AECOM to develop a set of public-facing dashboards that described the
            current status as well as historical data surrounding demographics, housing, and commercial real estate. To
            create these dashboards, AECOM leveraged data from multiple sources – the American Community Survey, Bureau
            of Labor Statistics, Lightcast.io, CoStar, and City of Plano data. The dashboards were created using ESRI
            software, including the ArcGIS API for Python, Experience Builder, and ArcGIS HubSite. These dashboards
            analysed metrics at a geospatial level, using Plano’s neighbourhoods as a geographic unit, or through point
            data. Across the three dashboards, this study consisted of over 50 unique, interactive maps.</p>
        <p>For the demographics dashboard, in-house Python scripts were developed to connect to the Census Bureau’s API
            and pull and analyse data on metrics such as population, median income, race and ethnicity, education and
            owner and renter statistics. Historical data from 2010 was compared to the most recent year of data, and
            using the ArcGIS API for Python, the mapping process was automated. This dashboard allows users to identify
            changes in time across the City of Plano.</p>
        <p>The housing dashboard was primarily concerned with the current state of housing in the City – availability,
            pricing, and conditions. Using American Community Survey data as well as in-house City of Plano data, this
            dashboard shed light on several advanced metrics such as the susceptibility to change, investor-confidence
            ratio, and Area-Median-Income (AMI) tiers. This dashboard also leveraged Census LODES data to map commuting
            sources and destinations for residents across the Dallas metro area, supplemented by an insight into
            Jobs-Housing balances for the constituent cities.</p>
        <p>The commercial real estate dashboard (also pictured above) analysed growth in employment, growth in
            commercial space over time, commercial susceptibility to change, recent additions and renovations, and
            change in commercial property valuation over time. This dashboard leveraged data from Lightcast.io, CoStar,
            and the City of Plano to provide a clearer picture of the past and present of commercial real estate across
            the City.</p>
        <p>Finally, AECOM has also been contracted to annually update these dashboards with data from the most recent
            year available.</p>
